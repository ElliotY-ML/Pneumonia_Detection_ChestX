    "**Author:**  Elliot Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Name of your Device:**  Machine Learning Model for Pneumonia Detection on Chest X-Rays \n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Description \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. General Information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intended Use Statement:**   <br>This algorithm is comprised of a Convolutional Neural Network model to analyze Chest X-Ray images to detect the presence of pneumonia.  It is intended to assist radiologists in the clinical setting and should be used in conjunction with a Radiologist's review of the Xray, sputnum cultures, and a review of a patient's medical history for diagnostic validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indications for Use:**  <br>This algorithm may be applied to patients who's medical history may indicate pneumonia infection, of ages 1 thru 95 and of gender Male or Female. X-Ray images must be taken with a PA or AP viewing position.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Device Limitations:**  <br>This algorithm must be run with a computer that meet minimum GPU and RAM requirements.\n",
    "<br> Furthermore, presence of Infiltration may confound device performance.  Infiltration may cause the device to classify an X-Ray image as Positive Pneumonia.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clinical Impact of Performance:**  <br>The goal of this device is assist Radiologists with their review of X-Rays for indications of Pneumonia.  A Radiologist is required to review all X-Rays and validate results.<br>When this device incorrectly predicts a False Positive, a patient may be directed for a sputnum culture and the diagnosis can be validated with the sputnum culture.  <br>\n",
    "On the other hand, a False Negative can adversely impact a patient.  If the False Negative is not revised by a Radiologist, a clinician may proceed with an incorrect diagnosis and not proceed to sputnum cultures.\n",
    "<br>Therefore, it is critical for Radiologists to review and validate all results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Algorithm Design and Function\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**DICOM Checking Steps:**\n",
    "<br>Check DICOM Headers for: \n",
    "<br>Modality == 'DX'\n",
    "<br>BodyPartExamined=='CHEST'\n",
    "<br>PatientPosition in 'PA' or'AP' Position\n",
    "<br>If any of these three categories do not match their respective requirements, \n",
    "then a message will state that the DICOM does not meet criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing Steps:**\n",
    "<br>For DICOMs that pass the intial Header check, the DICOM pixel array will be opened.\n",
    "A copy of the DICOM pixel array will be normalized and then resized to 224 by 224 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**CNN Architecture:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Sequential Model was built by Fine-tuning the VGG16 Model with ImageNet weights.\n",
    "<br>This model takes the VGG16 model layers up to and including the block5_pool.  <br>Layers taken from the VGG16 model were frozen, so that their weights were not trained.  Output from this pre-trained model was flattened.\n",
    "<br>These following layers were added:\n",
    "<br>(Dense(1024, activation = 'relu'))\n",
    "<br>(Dropout(0.5))\n",
    "<br>(Dense(512, activation = 'relu'))\n",
    "<br>(Dropout(0.5))\n",
    "<br>(Dense(256, activation = 'relu'))\n",
    "<br>(Dropout(0.5))\n",

    " \n",
    "Based on EDA work, the Data_Entr_2017.cvs contains 1,431 Images positive for Pneumonia and 110,689 Images negative for Pneumonia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set was split into 80% Training data and 20% for validation data.\n",

    "### 5. Ground Truth\n",
    "<br> The dataset used in this project was curated by the NIH.  It is comprised of 112,120 X-Ray images with disease labels from 30,805 unique patients.  The disease labels for each image were created using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to process associated radiological reports.  The estimated accuracy of the NLP labeling accuracy is estimated to be >90%.  \n",
    "This limitation on the NLP accuracy cannot be rectified, because the original radiology reports are not publically available to review and confirm labels. If these reports are available for human review, then the labels' accuracy will be reasonably higher.\n",

    "### 6. FDA Validation Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "**Patient Population Description for FDA Validation Dataset:**\n",
    "<br>The patient population should consist of Males and Females in a ratio of approximately 1:1, of ages 95 and younger, and are being screened for Pneumonia.  The expected rate of Positive Pneumonia cases is approximately 20% of those being screened.  <br>Imaging modality must be X-Rays (Code DX) of frontal positions (PA or AP) on Patient Chests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ground Truth Acquisition Methodology:**\n",
    "<br>The purpose of this device is to assist Radiologist with their workflow.\n",
    "The optimal ground truth for this purpose would be the Radiologist's review of the X-Ray with medical history available to them, including lab reports.\n",
    "To bypass inaccuracies introduced by NLP, a digital form should be provided to Radiologists to mark diseases that they see with each X-Ray review.  The checklist would included common lung diseases such as the 14 diseases in this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm Performance Standard:**\n",
    "<br>Based on the provided paper by P.Rajpurkarpar, et al., the performance standard is F1 scores comparing radiologists and algorithms.  F1 scores are the harmonic average of the precision and recall of the models.\n",
    "<br>Rajpurkarpar's CheXNet algorithm achieve an F1 score of 0.435, while Radiologists averaged an F1 score of 0.387.  These would be the benchmarks to compare newly developed algorihms to. "
